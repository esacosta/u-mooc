		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">Mr. Trippe, Mr. Rockefeller, General Clay, gentlemen:</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">I feel tonight somewhat like I felt when 
		<a href="jfkhoustonministers.html">I addressed in 
		1960 the Houston Ministers Conference</a> on the separation of church and 
		state. But I am glad to have a chance to talk to you tonight about the 
		advantages of the free enterprise system.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">Less than a month ago, this nation reminded the world 
		that it possessed both the will and the weapons to meet any threat to 
		the security of free men. The gains we have made will not be given up 
		and the course that we have pursued will not be abandoned. But in the 
		long run, that security will not be determined by military or diplomatic 
		moves alone. It will be affected by the decisions of finance ministers, 
		as well as by the decisions of Secretaries of State and Secretaries of 
		Defense; by the deployment of fiscal and monetary weapons, as well as by 
		military weapons; and, above all, by the strength of this nation's 
		economy, as well as by the strength of our defenses.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">You will recall that Chairman Khrushchev has said that he 
		believed that the hinge of world history would begin to move when the 
		Soviet Union out-produced the United States. Therefore, the subject to 
		which we address ourselves tonight concerns not merely our own 
		well-being, but also very vitally the defense of the free world. </font>
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">America's rise to world leadership in the century since 
		the Civil War has reflected more than anything else our unprecedented 
		economic growth. Interrupted during the decade of the 30s, the vigorous 
		expansion of our economy was resumed in 1940 and continued for more than 
		15 years thereafter. It demonstrated for all to see the power of freedom 
		and the efficiency of free institutions. The economic health of this 
		nation has been, and is now, fundamentally sound.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">But a leading nation, a nation upon which all depend, not 
		only in this country but around the world, cannot afford to be 
		satisfied, to look back, or to pause. On our strength and growth depends 
		the strength of others, the spread of free world trade and unity, and 
		continued confidence in our leadership and our currency. The 
		underdeveloped countries are dependent upon us for the sale of their 
		primary commodities and for aid to their struggling economies. In short, 
		a prosperous and growing America is important not only to Americans, it 
		is — as the spokesman for 20 Western nations in the 
		<a href="http://www.oecd.org/home/">Organization for 
		Economic Cooperation and Development<span style="text-decoration: none">,</span></a> as he stressed this week — of 
		vital importance to the entire Western World.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">In the last two years we have made significant strides. 
		Our gross national product has risen eleven percent, while inflation has been 
		arrested. Employment has been increased by one-point-three million jobs. 
		Profits, personal income, living standards — all are setting new 
		records. Most of the economic indicators for this quarter are up and the 
		prospects are for further expansion in the next quarter. But we must 
		look beyond the next quarter, or the last quarter, or even the last two 
		years. For we can and must do better, much better than we've been doing 
		for the last five-and-a-half years.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">This economy is capable of producing, without strain, 30 
		to 40 billion [dollars] more than we are producing today. Business 
		earnings could be seven to eight billion higher than they are today. 
		Utilization of existing plant and equipment could be much higher — and, 
		if it were, investment would rise. We need not accept an unemployment 
		rate of five percent or more, such as we have had for 60 out of the last 
		61 months. There is no need for us to be satisfied with a rate of growth 
		that keeps good men out of work and good capacity out of use.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">The Economic Club of New York is, of course, familiar 
		with these problems. For, in this state, the rate of insured 
		unemployment has been persistently higher than the national average, and 
		the increases in personal income and employment have been slower here 
		than [in] the nation as a whole. You have seen the tragedy of chronically 
		depressed areas upstate, of unemployed young people — and I think this 
		might be one of our most serious national problems, unemployed young 
		people, those under 20. One out of four are unemployed — particularly 
		those in the minority groups, roaming the streets of New York and our 
		other great cities — and others on relief at an early age, with the 
		prospect that in this decade we will have between seven and eight 
		million school dropouts, unskilled, coming into the labor market, at a 
		time when the need for unskilled labor is steadily diminishing. And I 
		know you share my conviction that, proud as we are of its progress, this 
		nation's economy can and must do even better than it has done in the 
		last five years. Our choice, therefore, boils down to one of: doing 
		nothing, and thereby risking a widening gap between our actual and 
		potential growth in output, profits, and employment — or taking action, 
		at the federal level, to raise our entire economy to a new and higher 
		level of business activity.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">If we do not take action, those who have the most reason 
		to be dissatisfied with our present rate of growth will be tempted to 
		seek shortsighted and narrow solutions — to resist automation, to reduce 
		the work week to 35 hours or even lower, to shut out imports, or to 
		raise prices in a vain effort to obtain full capacity profits on 
		under-capacity operations. But these are all self-defeating expedients 
		which can only restrict the economy, not expand it.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">There are a number of ways by which the federal 
		government can meet its responsibilities to aid economic growth. We can 
		and must improve American education and technical training. We can and 
		must expand civilian research and technology. One of the great 
		bottlenecks for this country's economic growth in this decade will be 
		the shortages of doctorates in mathematics, engineering, and physics — a 
		serious shortage with a great demand and an undersupply of highly 
		trained manpower. We can and must step up the development of our natural 
		resources. </font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">But the most direct and significant kind of federal 
		action aiding economic growth is to make possible an increase in private 
		consumption and investment demand — to cut the fetters which hold back 
		private spending. In the past, this could be done in part by the 
		increased use of credit and monetary tools, but our balance of payments 
		situation today places limits on our use of those tools for expansion. 
		It could also be done by increasing federal expenditures more rapidly 
		than necessary, but such a course would soon demoralize both the 
		government and our economy. If government is to retain the confidence of 
		the people, it must not spend more than can be justified on grounds of 
		national need or spent with maximum efficiency. And I shall say more on this 
		in a moment.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">The final and best means of strengthening demand among 
		consumers and business is to reduce the burden on private income and the 
		deterrents to private initiative which are imposed by our present tax 
		system — and this administration pledged itself last summer to an 
		across-the-board, top-to-bottom cut in personal and corporate income 
		taxes to be enacted and become effective in 1963.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">I'm not talking about a &quot;quickie&quot; or a temporary tax 
		cut, which would be more appropriate if a recession were imminent. Nor 
		am I talking about giving the economy a mere shot in the arm, to ease 
		some temporary complaint. I am talking about the accumulated evidence of 
		the last five years that our present tax system, developed as it was, in 
		good part, during World War II to restrain growth, exerts too heavy a 
		drag on growth in peace time; that it siphons out of the private economy 
		too large a share of personal and business purchasing power; that it 
		reduces the financial incenitives [sic] for personal effort, investment, and 
		risk-taking. In short, to increase demand and lift the economy, the 
		federal government's most useful role is not to rush into a program of 
		excessive increases in public expenditures, but to expand the incentives 
		and opportunities for private expenditures.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">Under these circumstances, any new tax legislation — and 
		you can understand that under the comity which exists in the United 
		States Constitution whereby the Ways and Means Committee in the House of 
		Representatives have the responsibility of initiating this legislation, 
		that the details of any proposal should wait on the meeting of the 
		Congress in January. But you can understand that, under these 
		circumstances, in general, that any new tax legislation enacted next 
		year should meet the following three tests:</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">First, it should reduce the net taxes by a sufficiently early 
		date and a sufficiently large amount to do the job required. Early 
		action could give us extra leverage, added results, and important 
		insurance against recession. Too large a tax cut, of course, could 
		result in inflation and insufficient future revenues — but the greater 
		danger is a tax cut too little, or too late, to be effective.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">Second, the new tax bill must increase private 
		consumption, as well as investment. Consumers are still spending between 
		92 and 94 percent on their after-tax income, as they have every year 
		since 1950. But that after-tax income could and should be greater, 
		providing stronger markets for the products of American industry. When 
		consumers purchase more goods, plants use more of their capacity, men 
		are hired instead of laid-off, investment increases, and profits are 
		high.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">Corporate tax rates must also be cut to increase 
		incentives and the availability of investment capital. The government 
		has already taken major steps this year to reduce business tax liability 
		and to stimulate the modernization, replacement, and expansion of our 
		productive plant and equipment. We have done this through the 1962 
		investment tax credit and through the liberalization of depreciation 
		allowances — two essential parts of our first step in tax revision — 
		which amounted to a ten percent reduction in corporate income taxes 
		worth 2.5 billion dollars. Now we need to increase consumer 
		demand to make these measures fully effective — demand which will make 
		more use of existing capacity and thus increase both profits and the 
		incentive to invest. In fact, profits after taxes would be at least 15 
		percent higher today if we were operating at full employment.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">For all these reasons, next year's tax bill should reduce 
		personal as well as corporate income taxes: for those in the lower 
		brackets, who are certain to spend their additional take-home pay, and 
		for those in the middle and upper brackets, who can thereby be 
		encouraged to undertake additional efforts and enabled to invest more 
		capital.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">Third, the new tax bill should improve both the equity 
		and the simplicity of our present tax system. This means the enactment 
		of long-needed tax reforms, a broadening of the tax base, and the 
		elimination or modification of many special tax privileges. These steps 
		are not only needed to recover lost revenue and thus make possible a 
		larger cut in present rates, they are also tied directly to our goal of 
		greater growth. For the present patchwork of special provisions and 
		preferences lightens the tax loads of some only at the cost of placing a 
		heavier burden on others. It distorts economic judgments and channels  
		undue amounts of energy into efforts to avoid tax liability. It makes 
		certain types of less productive activity more profitable than other 
		more valuable undertakings. All this inhibits our growth and efficiency, 
		as well as considerably complicating the work of both the taxpayer and 
		the Internal Revenue Service.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">These various exclusions and concessions have been 
		justified [in the past] as a means of overcoming oppressively high rates in 
		the upper brackets, and a sharp reduction in those rates — accompanied 
		by base-broadening, loophole-closing measures — would properly make the 
		new rates not only lower, but also more widely applicable. Surely this 
		is more equitable on both counts.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">Those are the three tests which the right kind of bill 
		must meet — and I am confident that the enactment of the right bill next 
		year will in due course increase our gross national product by several 
		times the amount of taxes actually cut. Profit margins will be improved, 
		and both the incentive to invest and the supply of internal funds for 
		investment will be increased. There will be new interest in taking 
		risks, in increasing productivity, in creating new jobs and new products 
		for long-term economic growth.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">Other national problems, moreover, will be aided by full 
		employment. It will encourage the location of new plants in areas of 
		labor surplus — and provide new jobs for workers that we are retraining 
		— and facilitate the adjustment which will be necessary under our new 
		trade expansion bill, and reduce a number of government expenditures.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">It will not, I'm confident, revive an inflationary spiral 
		or adversely affect our balance of payments. If the economy today were 
		operating close to capacity levels with little unemployment, or if a 
		sudden change in our military requirements should cause a scramble for 
		men and resources, then I would oppose tax reductions as irresponsible 
		and inflationary — and I would not hesitate to recommend a tax increase, 
		if that were necessary. But our resources and manpower are not being 
		fully utilized, the general level of prices has been remarkably stable, 
		and increased competition — both at home and abroad — along with 
		increased productivity, will help keep both prices and wages within 
		appropriate limits.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">The same is true of our balance of payments. While rising 
		demand will expand imports, new investment in more efficient productive 
		facilities will aid exports, and a new economic climate could both draw 
		capital from abroad and keep capital here at home. It will also put us 
		in a better position, if necessary, to use monetary tools to help our 
		international accounts. But most importantly, confidence in the dollar 
		in the long run rests on confidence in America, in our ability to meet 
		our economic commitments and reach our economic goals. In a worldwide 
		conviction that we are not drifting from recession to recession with no 
		answer, the substantial improvement in our balance of payments position 
		in the last two years makes it clear that nothing could be more foolish 
		than to restrict our growth merely to minimize that particular problem, 
		because a slowdown in our economy will feed that problem rather than 
		diminish it. On the contrary, European governmental and financial 
		authorities with almost total unanimity, far from threatening to 
		withdraw gold, have urged us to cut taxes in order to expand our 
		economy, attract more capital, and increase confidence in our future.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">But what concerns most Americans about a tax cut, I know, 
		is not the deficit in our balance of payments but the deficit in our 
		federal budget. When I announced in April of 1961 that this kind of 
		comprehensive tax reform would follow the bill enacted this year, I had 
		hoped to present it in an atmosphere of a balanced budget. But it has 
		been necessary to augment sharply our nuclear and conventional forces, 
		to step up our efforts in space, to meet the increased cost of servicing 
		the national debt and meeting our obligations — established by law — to 
		veterans. These expenditure increases, let me stress, constitute 
		practically all of the increases which have occurred under this 
		administration, the remainder having gone to fight the recession we 
		found in industry — mostly through the 
		<a href="http://www.policyalmanac.org/social_welfare/archive/unemployment_compensation.shtml">
		Supplemental Unemployment Compensation Bill</a> — 
		and in agriculture.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">We shall, therefore, neither postpone our tax cut plans 
		nor cut into essential national security programs. This administration 
		is determined to protect America's security and survival, and we are also 
		determined to step up its economic growth. And I think we must do both.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">Our true choice is not between tax reduction, on the one 
		hand, and the avoidance of large federal deficits on the other. It is 
		increasingly clear that no matter what party is in power, so long as our 
		national security needs keep rising, an economy hampered by restrictive 
		tax rates will never produce enough revenues to balance our budget — just 
		as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits. Surely the 
		lesson of the last decade is that budget deficits are not caused by 
		wild-eyed spenders but by slow economic growth and periodic recessions, 
		and any new recession would break all deficit records.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are 
		too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to 
		raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now. The 
		experience of a number of European countries and Japan have borne this 
		out. This country's own experience with tax reduction in 1954 has borne 
		this out. And the reason is that only full employment can balance the 
		budget, and tax reduction can pave the way to that employment. The 
		purpose of cutting taxes now is not to incur a budget deficit, but to 
		achieve the more prosperous, expanding economy which can bring a budget 
		surplus.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">I repeat: our practical choice is not between a tax-cut 
		deficit and a budgetary surplus. It is between two kinds of deficits: a 
		chronic deficit of inertia, as the unwanted result of inadequate 
		revenues and a restricted economy, or a temporary deficit of transition, 
		resulting from a tax cut designed to boost the economy, increase tax 
		revenues, and achieve, I believe — and I believe this can be done — a budget 
		surplus. The first type of deficit is a sign of waste and weakness; the 
		second reflects an investment in the future.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">Nevertheless, as Chairman Mills of the House Ways and 
		Means Committee pointed out this week, the size of the deficit is to be 
		regarded with concern, and tax reduction must be accompanied, in his 
		words, by &quot;increased control of the rises in expenditures.&quot; This is 
		precisely the course we intend to follow in 1963.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">At the same time as our tax program is presented to the 
		Congress in January, the federal budget for fiscal 1964 will also be 
		presented. Defense and space expenditures will necessarily rise in order 
		to carry out programs which are demanded and are necessary for our own 
		security, and which have largely been authorized by Members in both 
		parties of the Congress with overwhelming majorities. Fixed interest 
		charges on the debt also rise slightly. But I can tell you now that the 
		total of all other expenditures combined will be held at approximately 
		its current level.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">This is not an easy task. During the past nine years, 
		domestic civilian expenditures in the national government have risen at 
		an average rate of more than seven-and-one-half percent. State and local 
		government expenditures have risen at an annual rate of nine percent. 
		Expenditures by the New York State government, for example, have risen 
		in recent years at the rate of roughly ten percent per year. At a time 
		when government pay scales have necessarily risen — and I take New York 
		just as an example — when our -- when our population and pressures -- 
		when our population and pressures are growing and 
		the demand for services and state aid is thus increasing, next year's 
		federal budget, which will hold domestic outlays at their present level, 
		will represent a genuine effort in expenditure control. This budget will 
		reflect, among other economies, a 750 million dollar reduction in the 
		postal deficit. It will reflect a savings of over 300 million dollars in 
		the storage costs of surplus feed grain stocks — and as a result of the 
		<a href="http://www.jfklink.com/speeches/jfk/publicpapers/1961/jfk300_61.html">feed grain bill of 1961</a>, we will have two-thirds less in storage than we 
		would otherwise have had in January 1963 — and a saving[s] of at least 600 
		million dollars from the cancellation of obsolete or unworkable weapons 
		systems. Secretary McNamara is undertaking a cost reduction program 
		expected to save three billion dollars a year in the Department 
		of Defense, cutting down on duplication and closing down nonessential 
		installations. Other agencies must do the same.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">In addition, I have directed all heads of government 
		departments and agencies to hold federal employment under the levels 
		authorized by congressional appropriations, to absorb through greater 
		efficiency a substantial part of this year's federal pay increase, to 
		achieve an increase in productivity which will enable the same amount of 
		work to be done by less people, and to refrain from spending any 
		unnecessary funds that were appropriated by the Congress.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">It should also be noted that the federal debt, as a 
		proportion of our gross national product, has been steadily reduced in 
		the last years. Last year the total increase in the federal debt was two 
		percent — compared to an eight percent increase in the gross debt of 
		state and local governments. Taking a longer view, the federal debt 
		today is 13 percent higher than it was in 1946, while state and local 
		debt is 360 percent higher than it was in 1946 -- and private debt by over 300 percent. In 
		fact, if it were not for federal financial assistance to state and local 
		governments, the federal cash budget would show a surplus. Federal 
		civilian employment, for example, is actually lower today than it was in 
		1952, while state and local government employment over the same period 
		has increased 67 percent.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoPlainText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		<font size="2">It is this setting which makes federal tax reduction both 
		possible and appropriate next year. I do not underestimate the obstacles 
		which the Congress will face in enacting such legislation. No one will 
		be satisfied. Everyone will have his own approach, his own bill, his own 
		reductions. A high order of restraint and determination will be required 
		if the &quot;possible&quot; is not to wait on the &quot;perfect.&quot; But a nation capable 
		of marshaling these qualities in any dramatic threat to our security, is 
		surely capable, as a great free society, of meeting a slower and more 
		complex threat to our economic vitality. This nation can afford to 
		reduce taxes, we can afford a temporary deficit — but we cannot afford 
		to do nothing. For on the strength of our free economy rests the hope of 
		all free nations. We shall not fail that hope — for free men and free 
		nations must prosper and they must prevail. Thank you.</font></span></p>
