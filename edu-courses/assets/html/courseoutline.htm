<p><strong>1.  Course Number and Name: </strong>Econ400, Supply-Side Economics: Taxation from Warren Harding to Ronald Reagan<strong></strong><br>
    <strong>     </strong><br>
    <strong>Credits:  Non-credit</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.  Course Description</strong> <br>
  Econ4000,  Supply-side Economics, introduces students to the neo-classical view of the  economy, as modernized and applied to public policy formulation by economists  Robert Mundell, Arthur Laffer, Norman Ture, Richard Rahn and others.  Supply-side Economics attempts to familiarize students with the historical  context in which supply-side economics became a major force in the United  States (and internationally) – in the 1970s and 1980s, the time associated with  the “Reagan Revolution” in economic policy. </p>
<p>The  course focuses on the history of taxation in the United States beginning with  the Harding/Mellon tax cuts and attempts to demonstrate how the neo-classical  system is derived from the basic workings of the economy, beginning with the  fundamental observation that income is the reward for the production of goods  and services by people who supply labor and capital services. </p>
<p>This  historical review describes how fiscal and regulatory policies affect the  economy by altering incentives to supply labor and capital inputs, and by  imposing or reducing obstacles to the production of goods and services.  The course examines the bad effects of the  Keynesian &#39;demand&quot; approach as seen in the failed presidencies of Jimmy  Carter, Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and explores appropriate uses of fiscal  and monetary policies, and how to combine them to promote non-inflationary  growth. It also explores the potential benefits of fundamental tax reform.</p>
<p><strong>3.  Course Goals</strong> <br>
  This  course in Supply-side Economics reviews the intellectual roots of supply-side  economics, dating back to Adam Smith and Jean Baptiste Say. It discusses the  growth of the supply-side movement in tax policies of the Harding  Administration that contributed to &#39;the Roaring Twenties&quot; and the revival  of these tax policies during the Kennedy Administration and into the 1970s,  when the American economy was beset by simultaneous inflation and high  unemployment.</p>
<p>Why  this “stagflation” was something that traditional Keynesian “demand-management”  economics could neither explain nor cure, is an important reason for the appeal  of Supply-side Economics.  The course  describes how supply-side economics offered a coherent analysis of the problem and  the only practical way out of the economic &#39;malaise&#39; of the American  economy..  </p>
<p><strong>4.  Course Learning Outcomes</strong> <br>
  This  course explores the intellectual origins and the practical applications of a  theory that transformed economic policies in many free-market economies during  the last quarter of the 20th century.  The theory still drives the design of tax  structures and business regulation today.   Upon completion of the course, the student will be able to:</p>
